    <h1>
      Creating Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery with GitHub
      Actions
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Although there are a number of third party actions to be found, I have
      decided not to use them.<br />
      For this I used a private server from DigitalOcean and have my app running
      on this server <br />
      So <em>DON'T</em> forget to push the necessary content from your local
      machine to the repository on git, and clone this repository at the erver
      side. So first setup the server side to access your repository, just like
      you do with your local machine. <br />
      When all of this is up and running, follow the steps I made.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Generate an SSH Key</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Do this on the private server.<br />
      SSH into the server with the following command. (You should already know
      this!)
    </p>
    <code>ssh username@ip-address</code>
    <p>
      When you are in the server cd into the <em>.shh</em> folder, where we
      create the SSH key.
    </p>
    <code>cd ~/.shh</code>
    <p>Create the SSH key using the following command.</p>
    <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"</code>
    <p>
      After that we will need to name the SSH Key file. I used the name
      <em>github-actions</em> so I know this key is used for Github Actions.
      <br />
      You are also be asked to provide a passphrase. Just leave this empty,
      because you can't enter passwords when Github Actions run the SSH command.
      <br />
      If you use the <em>ls</em> command, you should see your key in the
      <em>.ssh</em> folder. The public key has a <em>.pub</em> extension while
      the private key does not. <br />
      <code>ls</code>
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Adding the Public Key to authorized_keys</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We need to add the public key <em>github-actions.pub</em> to the private
      servers <em>authorized_keys</em> so machines using the private key
      <em>github-actions</em> can access the server. <br />
      We can easily do that using the <em>cat</em> command to append
      <em>github-actions.pub</em> to <em>authorized_keys</em>. <br />
    </p>
    <code>cat github-actions.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
    <p>
      This command grabs the content of <em>github-actions.pub</em> with
      <em>cat</em> end appends it to <em>authorized_keys</em> with <em>>></em>.
      Be sure to use <em>>></em> and not <em>></em> because a single bracket
      will overwrite the <em>authorized_keys</em> file.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Adding the private key to your repository's secrets</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Go to your repository on Github and click on <em>Settings</em> then
      <em>Secrets and variables</em> and click <em>Actions</em>. On the right
      side you can add a new repository secret by clicking
      <em>New repository secret</em>. <br />
      You have to specify a secret name and the contents. Later, in the Github
      Action workflow, you will use the secret name to get the contents. Write
      your secret name in uppercase and underscores as spaces. This is a format
      usually used for specifying secrets. <br />
      In this case I chose <em>SSH_PRIVATE_KEY</em> For the value we need to go
      back to the server and open <em>github-actions</em> using <em>Nano</em>.
    </p>
    <code>nano github-actions</code>
    <p>
      Select evertything from <em>-----BEGIN .....</em> to
      <em>.....PRIVATE KEY-----</em> and copy. Then paste it in the secret value
      at github and click <em>Add secret</em>.
      <br />
      You will find your new secret under the <em>Repository secrets</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Step 4: Adding the hostname and the username to your repository's secrets
    </h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      If we want to connect the Github repository with our server we will have
      to create some more secrets. <br />
      One for the hostname, our servers ip address, and one for the username.
      Also we make secrets for the branch and the working directory.
      <br />
      Create a new secret at github. <br />
      For the hostname use <em>SSH_HOST</em>, in the value field enter the ip
      address of your server. <br />
      For the username use <em>SSH_USER</em>, in the value field enter your
      <em>server</em> username. <br />
      Create a secret for the workdirectory at the host, the directory where you
      cloned the repository to. <br />
      Here I used <em>WORK_DIR</em>, in the value field enter your workdirectory
      path. The last secret I used is <em>MAIN_BRANCH</em>, in the value field
      enter the branch you wish to track, usually <em>main</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Writing the Github workflow</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and
      will run when triggered by an event in your repository (such as a push
      command), they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule. <br />
      They are defined in the <em>.github/workflows</em> as a
      <em>your_new.yml</em> file. Underneath I show you my pretty basic yaml
      file. <br />
      In this file I have written the necessary comments, but I leave the
      possibility for you to give your own interpretation. I will try not to
      repeat comments for lines which I have already explained.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In 5 steps we have created Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
      with GitHub. Maybe this has given you some insights and learned something
      from it. <br />
      Thanks for reading!
